What is JDBC ?
 It is a J2EE API, which is used to connect to any data base from the java code.

There are 2 types of database 
1. SQL Database 
 Data will be stored in form of table 
EG : Mysql , MsSql , Oracle 11 g , DB2 ,

2. No SQL Database 
 Data will be stored in the from JSON format
EG : Mango db , Casandra , NoSQL 

Types of Query 
1. Select query 
2. Non Select Query
1. Select Query 
Any query start from select is called select query, it’s always retunes data in the form of 
table

2. Non Select Query
Any query start from other than select is called non select query, it’s always retunes +/-
integer data


JDBC API: It is an API available in java.sql package, which is collection of interfaces with abstract 
method, class, & it is database independent


JDBC Driver: It is an implementation class of JDBC API provided by data base vendor. It is a database
dependent.


Why JDBC in Automation?
In Automation also we require JDBC Connection, because in few real time scenarios we require to 
connect to database for validation (execute test script pre-condition)
